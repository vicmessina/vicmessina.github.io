        <p>Writing is an art form of sorts — something that takes thought and time. I spend a lot of my time either writing or editing others’ work, and both sides of the writing process are passions of mine. Molding a story to its highest potential is a rewarding and satisfying process, and having your work published for the world to see is one of the best feelings. Here are a few stories I’ve had published on various platforms. The content of these clips showcase the range of my interests and writing abilities. Enjoy!</p>

        <p>CollegeFashionista is a website that focuses on fashion trends on college campuses. As a writer, it my job to find stylish students on campus to photograph and write about each week.

Documenting fashion trends in different countries that summer was a dream come true, and I learned a lot about the nature of fashion trends while doing so. <a href="http://www.collegefashionista.com/author/victoriamessina/" target="_blank" >Here</a> you can check out all of my articles to date, but below are a few of my favorites. </p>
