        <p>Writing is an art form of sorts — something that takes thought and time. I spend a lot of my time either writing or editing others’ work, and both sides of the writing process are passions of mine. Molding a story to its highest potential is a rewarding and satisfying process, and having your work published for the world to see is one of the best feelings. Here are a few stories I’ve had published on various platforms. These content of these clips showcase the range of my interests and writing abilities. Enjoy!</p>
